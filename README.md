# Canceled Or Not

A fun app made with the [Remix](https://remix.run) [Indie Stack](https://github.com/remix-run/indie-stack).

You can search for anything or anyone and the app pulls in search results from Wikipedia. You can then vote on how "canceled" the entity and see how others have voted. A user identity is maintained through a cookie session so that one user cannot vote multiple times on the same entity.
